## About the App:
The application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score will be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.
